# NIH Cheast X-ray

## *Problem Statement*:

Chest X-rays are critical in diagnosing various thoracic diseases, but their interpretation can be challenging due to the complexity and variety of conditions present. Current automated systems for detecting and classifying these conditions are limited by the lack of accurate, large-scale annotated datasets and the difficulty in achieving high accuracy. The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model capable of accurately detecting and classifying various findings in chest X-ray images from the NIH Chest X-ray dataset. The model will leverage convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning to identify diseases such as pneumonia, cardiomegaly, pneumothorax, and others. By achieving high accuracy and efficient model performance, the system aims to assist clinicians in diagnosing diseases from chest X-rays more accurately and promptly, ultimately improving patient care outcomes.


## *Data Sets*:

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Chest X-ray Dataset is one of the largest publicly available collections of chest X-ray images, designed to facilitate the development of computer-aided detection (CAD) systems for medical imaging. This dataset contains 112,120 X-ray images from 30,805 unique patients, covering 14 common thoracic diseases, as well as images labeled as "No Findings." The labels were generated using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract disease classifications from associated radiology reports, achieving over 90% accuracy. The dataset includes a diverse set of images with varying disease conditions, making it valuable for training deep learning models. However, it has limitations, such as potential labeling errors and limited bounding box annotations for specific diseases. Despite these challenges, this dataset provides a crucial resource for advancing machine learning applications in medical imaging.
